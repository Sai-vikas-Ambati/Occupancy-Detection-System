# Hardware Components

| Component                    | Quantity | Description / Role |
|-----------------------------|----------:|--------------------|
| STM32 Microcontroller       | 1         | Main processing unit for sensor control and Bluetooth communication |
| Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) | 2         | Detect entry and exit events by measuring distance/proximity |
| Bluetooth Module (HC-05)    | 1         | Enables wireless communication with external devices |
| Power Supply (5V/3.3V)      | 1         | Regulated power for MCU and sensors |
| Breadboard / PCB            | 1         | Mounting/wiring for prototyping |

## Schematic
- Add `hardware/schematic.png` to show wiring between STM32, two HC-SR04 sensors, HC-05 and the power supply.
